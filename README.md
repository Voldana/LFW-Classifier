# LFW-Classifier
___
### Description
This is the final project for Computational AI course held in fall of 2021.

In this project we're using the LFW (Labeled faces in the wild) dataset which contains pictures of celebrities faces. within the dataset there are folders labeled with people's names on them and inside there are a series of pictures. The pictures are then turned into a text file using VGGFace model and the text file is saved right next to the pictures.

We're supposed to train a classifier using the methods of ensemble learning and use that classifier to check if two pictures belong to the same person or not.
